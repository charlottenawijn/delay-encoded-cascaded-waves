Supplementary Material for "Delay-Encoded Cascaded Waves for Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging"

- _DE_CW_delay_optimization_CN_GL_20240711.m_
  
  Optimization algorithm to determine the interpulse delays in a delay-encoded cascaded waves pulse train, by numerically maximizing an expression describing the gain in signal-to-noise ratio within a given bandwidth.
  _single_pulses.zip_ contains waveforms of individual pulses of four ultrasound probes, which can be used to design a delay-encoded cascaded waves transmission.
  
- Example script for a Verasonics Vantage 256 research ultrasound system to transmit a delay-encoded pulse train.
