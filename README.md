Supplementary Material for "Delay-Encoded Cascaded Waves for Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging"

- Optimization algorithm to determine the interpulse delays in a delay-encoded pulse train, by numerically maximizing an expression describing the gain in signal-to-noise ratio within a given bandwidth.
- Example script for a Verasonics Vantage 256 research ultrasound system to transmit a delay-encoded pulse train.
